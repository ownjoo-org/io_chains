    """
    Subscriber that buffers items in a queue for iteration.

    Supports both async and sync iteration:
        async for item in collector: ...   (preferred; works inside a running event loop)
        for item in collector: ...         (works after the pipeline has completed)

    When subscribed via subscribe(channel=...) from multiple upstreams, the Collector
    automatically counts how many channels are wired (via _register_upstream) and waits
    for all of them to send EndOfStream before stopping iteration.
