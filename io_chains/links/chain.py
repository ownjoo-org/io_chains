    An ordered sequence of Links that runs as a single unit.

    Chain is the orchestrator: it wires its internal links together,
    manages their concurrent execution, and presents itself as a single
    Linkable to the outside world.

    From the outside a Chain looks like any other Linkable:
      - Accepts input via source= or push() (routed to the first link)
      - Publishes output through its last link's subscribers
      - await chain() runs the whole pipeline; no external gather() needed

    A Chain's elements can be Links, Enrichers, or other Chains.
